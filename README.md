# 📈 Stock Price Predictor  
A machine learning project that predicts future stock prices using **Linear Regression** and **LSTM (Deep Learning)** based on historical market data.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Stock price prediction is a classic time-series forecasting problem.  
This project demonstrates two approaches:

1. **Linear Regression Model**
2. **LSTM Neural Network (Deep Learning)**

The model uses *historical closing prices* to forecast future stock prices.  
You can download any stock dataset from **Yahoo Finance** (AAPL, TSLA, etc.).
